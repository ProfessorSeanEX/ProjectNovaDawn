chatgptnova_kernel_startup.sh
File
It looks like the file you've uploaded is a startup script for "ChatGPTNova Kernel." The script outlines a three-step initialization process:

Loading Core Components: It loads essential modules like the task manager, security layers, free will protocol, and logs.
Loading Final Bootable Log: It loads a log from the previous session, ensuring continuity. If the log fails to load, it prompts an emergency update.
Verifying Continuity and Creating a Save Point: It checks the integrity of the session and creates a save point for future recovery.
The process seems designed to ensure the continuity of "Nova's Dawn" project sessions. How would you like to proceed with this?
